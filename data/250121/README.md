The questions:

What is the distribution of climbing status (PSTATUS) across different mountain ranges (HIMAL_FACTOR)?
Which mountain range (HIMAL_FACTOR) has the highest average peak height (HEIGHTM)?
What is the distribution of peak heights (HEIGHTM) for peaks that are open (OPEN) versus those that are not?
Which climbing routes (ROUTE1, ROUTE2, ROUTE3, ROUTE4) have the highest success rates (SUCCESS1, SUCCESS2, SUCCESS3, SUCCESS4) across all expeditions?
How does the use of supplemental oxygen (O2USED, O2NONE) affect summit success rates?
How often does bad weather (TERMREASON = 4) play a role in termination compared to technical difficulty (TERMREASON = 10)?
Are expeditions with no hired personnel (NOHIRED) associated with higher or lower death rates?
